In this analysis, multiple machine learning models were evaluated to classify data, focusing on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance. The goal was to identify the best-performing models in terms of both individual accuracy and the ability to handle imbalanced classes effectively. The models ranged from traditional classifiers like Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to ensemble methods and advanced techniques such as Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) and XGBoost. Additionally, various ensemble strategies, such as stacking and bagging, were implemented to examine their potential to improve overall performance.
The results indicate that while some models performed consistently well across all metrics, others showed strengths in specific areas or struggled with certain class imbalances. Models like **Random Forest (RF)** and **KD Tree** emerged as the top performers, providing robust and balanced accuracy. On the other hand, **SGDClassifier (Mini-Batch)** and **Bagging Classifiers** faced challenges and displayed weaker performance. Ensemble techniques, particularly those combining RF with other classifiers, also showed potential but did not always outperform individual models.
In the following sections, the performance metrics for each model are compared in detail, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses. These findings provide guidance on selecting the most suitable models for similar classification tasks.
